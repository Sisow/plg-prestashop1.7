### About

PrestaShop started in 2005 as a student project. It was originally named phpOpenStore. Between May 2010 and April 2012, PrestaShop grew from 17 employees to more than a hundred. As of April 2016, PrestaShop has over 120 employees and offices in 6 countries. PrestaShop is currently used by more then 300,000 shops worldwide and it is available in 60 different languages.

The Buckaroo PrestaShop Payments Plugin is convenient and works like a charm, it's easy to install and takes all the trouble out of your hands. It is a plugin with many different payment methods, all of which are SEPA proof.

**Please note:** Buckaroo took over Sisow in 2021 and thereby all of their plugins. This PrestaShop plugin is the former Sisow version and it contains a ready-to-sell payment gateway for Buckaroo. However new functionalities will only be added in [Buckaroo's main PrestaShop plugin](https://github.com/buckaroo-it/PrestaShop) and not in this specific plugin.
